1. transmit cmd should set eop to ensure one packet for one mbuf
2. desc should copy len from mbuf
3. size of a array is the bytes size of the array
4. in writing we can read status using = to compare with DD because the last buf of packet bit set by ourselves in cmd
5. read status we should process last and DD which can not use = to compare
5. the process may write to the network while get an intr fo read network so that write need a lock but read don't
6. in write we can clean the desc when we need to write however for reading in an intr we need to clean all avliable desc
